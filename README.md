## Project Outline

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data. 

This is an interactive, timed JavaScript quiz that stores a high score leaderboard in local storage.
Developed in accordance with the following acceptance criteria: 

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

## Design Notes

* Responsive user interface achieved through the use of media queries

* Additional questions can be added without affecting functionality
